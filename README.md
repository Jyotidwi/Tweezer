# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
## Dependancies
Tweezer requires [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to be installed, and for ```analyzeHeadless``` to be on your path. If it is not on your path Tweezer will request on run where the binary is located. To install all other dependancies use the ```requirements.txt``` file, with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Running
Depending on if you already have a trained model/ map of vectors you may decide to run Tweezer in one of two ways, either 1) to train a new model/ extend an existing model or 2) to run Tweezer against a decompiled function or binary. 

### Training/ Extending the Model
```bash
python tweezer --model-path <model-path> --binary-locations <binary-folder-1> <binary-folder-2>...
```

### Finding Closest Functions
```bash
python tweezer --model-path <model-path> --function <path-to-decompiled-function>
```

### Building Function Name Map
```bash
python tweezer --model-path <model-path> --binary <path-to-binary>
```
